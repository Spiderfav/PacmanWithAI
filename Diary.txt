Week 1:

- During this week, I spent most of the time just researching all the techologies I needed to use for my project. These included the algorithms I am going to use as well as the technology needed to complete this project. 
- I have settled on using Golang as my main programming language as it is fast and efficient but, I still have Python in mind if anything goes wrong.
- I have made a list of all the things I need to research:
    - Pathfinding algorithms such as: Dijkstras, A*, Greedy 
    - How to implement Q learning algorithms for the final product
    - How to get a visual, game like interface in Golang to display the maze (using ebitten)


Week 2:

- In this week I had a go at making small programs in golang to get to grips on how to approach this language. 
    - As it is not exactly an object oriented language, trying to implement some ideas in an object oriented way is proving to be more difficult than expected.
- I have also discovered that there are many implementations of maze generating algorithms in golang to be used as packages as well as Pathfinding algorithms
    - This means I can maybe use their implementations and compare them to mine to check how efficient each is when running on the mazes created


Week 3:

- This week, I have begun working on the project and creating the maze graphically. The plan is to at least have a maze by the end of the week.
    - Proving to be more of a challenge than expected as the "ebitten" package that I'm using contains little to no documentation on how to properly use it
    - I am having to figure out how to draw each square on the screen and have it in a way that each square knows its neighbours (so that an algorithm like DFS can be applied to it and a maze created)
