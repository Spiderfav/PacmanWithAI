Randomly select a node (or cell) N.
Push the node N onto a queue Q.
Mark the cell N as visited.

Randomly select an adjacent cell A of node N that has not been visited.
 
If all the neighbors of N have been visited:
    Continue to pop items off the queue Q until a node is encountered with at least one non-visited neighbor - assign this node to N and go to step 4.
If no nodes exist: stop.

Break the wall between N and A.

Assign the value A to N.
Go to step 2.
