# Final Year Project

This repository has been created to store your final year project.

You may edit it as you like, but please do not remove the default topics or the project members list. These need to stay as currently defined in order for your supervisor to be able to find your project.

For the markers of the Project:

    - I have realised that some of my commits may have an account name as "Spiderfav" or "Rui Favinha". 
    
Now I don't exactly know how since my machines are using the access tokens created to commit the files. I've tried to change it now but if any commit appears as "Spiderfav" or "Rui Favinha", it really should appear as "Favinha Rui (2021) ZKAC432". "Spiderfav" is just my normal GitHub and online user handle.
